# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## deployment

```shell
âžœ  npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0x567DaC60eb2F76641BB7a39d8B8294b286D9cBC4
